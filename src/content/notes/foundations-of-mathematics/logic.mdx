Logic forms the backbone of mathematical reasoning, providing the rules and structure needed to analyze statements, construct proofs, and ensure the validity of arguments. By establishing clear principles for deduction and inference, logic helps mathematicians build reliable foundations for all areas of mathematics, making it essential for understanding and developing rigorous mathematical theories.

## Statements

In mathematical logic, a statement is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both. Statements are the basic building blocks of logical reasoning and proofs. Examples of statements include "2 is an even number" and "All prime numbers greater than 2 are odd." Statements can be combined using logical connectives such as "and," "or," and "not" to form more complex expressions.

## Tautologies and Conclusions
